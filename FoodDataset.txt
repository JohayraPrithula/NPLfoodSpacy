Wellness Core dry food not that much more in the end.  The moist food is a lot more expensive.
A quality white chicken pack that I use for sandwiches, salads, and even as a fill-in for our pup!

Our cats love Fancy Feast and the convenience of having their food delivered on a subscription basis.

Chalky chocolate, this is the New Hampshire version of Lindt 70% "Smooth Dark" rather than the "Extra Fine" or "Intense Dark"
